# Stampy Assets

Stampy is the friendly face of a `stampy.ai`, a source for comprehensive FAQ on artificial general intelligence (AGI) safety and [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment), backed by a growing community of like-minded volunteers.

## Story of the Logo
[![original logo](old/stampy-300.png)](old)

The current logo is a modernized rendition of the [original logo](old) inspired by the valuable 
[inverted Jenny stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_Jenny) 
and the face of the friendly 
[Microsoft Clippy office assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) with a nod to the paperclip maximizing conundrum presented by Nick Bostrom's [Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies).
